"""Migration helpers for the ``portal_berita`` app.

The team historically had a divergent migration history where
``0002_comment`` could be applied while the clean-up migration
``0002_remove_produk_kategori_remove_berita_ringkasan_and_more`` failed.

Users who ran the migrations during that period ended up with the comment
tables created, but Django recorded that ``0002_remove`` hadn't been
applied.  When newer versions of the project reintroduced the clean-up
migration, Django refused to run ``migrate`` because it detected the
missing dependency.

To keep existing databases working without forcing manual intervention, we
patch things up when the migration module is imported: if Django sees that
``0002_comment`` is already recorded but ``0002_remove`` isn't, we execute
the same defensive clean-up that the migration would have performed and
then mark the clean-up migration as applied.  This mirrors the effects of
the real migration while keeping the migration history consistent so
``python manage.py migrate`` can proceed normally for everyone.
